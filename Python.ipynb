        "\n",
        " Ans. Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python follows the philosophy of writing code that is easy to read and understand, often described by its guiding principle:\n",
        "\n",
        "“Simple is better than complex, and readability counts.” (from The Zen of Python)\n",
        "\n",
        " Why Python is Popular\n",
        "\n",
        "Python has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world because of several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple & Readable Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "Its syntax is very close to human language, making it easy to learn for beginners and efficient for experienced developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Printing “Hello, World!” requires just one line:\n",
        "\n",
        "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Versatility\n",
        "\n",
        "Python can be used for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, scripting, game development, IoT, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Standard Library & Frameworks\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, an interpreter is the program that executes Python code line by line instead of compiling the entire code into machine language at once (like C or Java compilers do).\n",
        "\n",
        " How the Python Interpreter Works\n",
        "\n",
        "You write code in a .py file (e.g., hello.py).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python interpreter reads your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "It converts the code into an intermediate form called bytecode.\n",

        "\n",
        " Key Points about the Python Interpreter\n",
        "\n",
        "Line by line execution → If an error occurs, it stops immediately and shows you the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Makes Python programs easier to debug, since you see results instantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different implementations exist:\n",
        "\n",
        "CPython → Default and most widely used (written in C).\n",

        ">>> print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
        "\n",

        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, pre-defined keywords (also called reserved words) are special words that have fixed meanings and purposes in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "You cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers because Python uses them to define its syntax and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are always written in lowercase (except True, False, and None).\n",
        "\n",
        " Examples of Python Keywords\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans.  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "Keywords are reserved words in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "They already have a special meaning and are part of the language’s syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you try to use them as variable names, Python will get confused about whether you mean the keyword or a variable.\n",

        "SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, if is a keyword used for conditions, so Python doesn’t allow it as a variable name.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, mutability refers to whether or not the value of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        " Types of Objects\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the list numbers is modified in place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects → Cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: int, float, string, tuple, frozenset, bool\n",
        "\n",
        "If you \"change\" them, a new object is created instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "text = \"hello\"\n",
        "text = text + \" world\"\n",
        "print(text)        # \"hello world\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice: Instead of modifying \"hello\", Python created a new string \"hello world\" and reassigned it to text.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.  Lists are mutable because:\n",
        "\n",
        "They are designed to store collections of items that may change.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can add, remove, or modify elements inside the same list without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list[0] = 10        # modify\n",
        "my_list.append(4)      # add\n",
        "print(my_list)         # [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the same list object is updated in place.\n",
        "\n",
        " Tuples are immutable because:\n",
        "\n",
        "They are meant to be fixed collections of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once created, the contents of a tuple cannot be changed — no adding, removing, or modifying.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "my_tuple[0] = 10       #  Error\n",

        "\n",
        "TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",

        " Why did Python designers make this distinction?\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects (like tuples) are faster to access and use less memory in certain cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since they don’t change, Python can optimize storage and reuse them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Safety\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are often used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionary keys must be hashable → only immutable objects can be hashed reliably.\n",

        "my_dict = {(1, 2): \"point\"}   #  works\n",
        "my_dict[[1, 2]] = \"point\"     # TypeError (list is mutable)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Use case difference\n",
        "\n",
        "List → for dynamic, changeable data.\n",

        "Implicit = Python automatically converts types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit = You manually tell Python to convert types.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want, I can also make a tiny diagram showing implicit vs explicit casting—it’s very easy to remember visually. Do you want me to do that.\n",

        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code only if specific conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, they help the program choose between different paths based on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision Making\n",
        "Conditional statements let the program respond differently in different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Control Flow\n",
        "They control the flow of the program by executing code only when certain conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduce Redundancy\n",
        "Instead of writing multiple programs for different scenarios, you can use conditional statements to handle all cases in one program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. if statement executes code if a condition is True\n",
        "\n",
        "age = 18\n",
        "if age >= 18:\n",
        "    print(\"You are an adult\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. if-else statement executes one block if True, another if False\n",
        "\n",
        "age = 16\n",
        "if age >= 18:\n",
        "    print(\"You are an adult\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"You are a minor\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. if-elif-else statement multiple conditions\n",
        "\n",
        "marks = 75\n",

        "    print(\"Grade: B\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade: C\").\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, the elif statement is short for “else if” and is used to check multiple conditions after an initial if statement. It allows you to handle more than two possible paths in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python first checks the if condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the if condition is True, its block executes, and Python skips all remaining elif and else blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the if condition is False, Python moves to the first elif and checks its condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "If that elif is True, its block executes, and Python skips the remaining elifs and else.\n",
        "\n",
        "If none of the if or elif conditions are True, Python executes the else block (if present).\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "if condition1:\n",
        "    # Code block for condition1\n",
        "elif condition2:\n",
        "    # Code block for condition2\n",
        "elif condition3:\n",
        "    # Code block for condition3\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    # Code block if none of the above conditions are True\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "score = 85\n",
        "\n",
        "if score >= 90:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade A\")\n",
        "elif score >= 75:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade B\")\n",
        "elif score >= 60:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade C\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Fail\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "Grade B\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, Python checks the if (False), then the first elif (True), executes it, and skips the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        " Key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can have multiple elif statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "elif is optional, but else is optional too.\n",
        "\n",
        "Only one block executes in a chain of if → elif → else.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.In Python, both for and while loops are used for repeating a block of code, but they work differently and are used in different situations. Here's a clear breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. for loop\n",
        "\n",
        "Used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat something.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range of numbers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatically moves to the next item in the sequence each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "for item in sequence:\n",
        "    # Code block\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "for fruit in fruits:\n",
        "    print(fruit)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "apple\n",
        "banana\n",
        "cherry\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Key point:\n",
        "The for loop stops automatically after going through all items in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. while loop\n",
        "\n",
        "Used when you want to repeat something as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of repetitions is not known in advance.\n",
        "\n",
        "You must manually update variables that affect the condition, otherwise you could create an infinite loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "while condition:\n",
        "    # Code block\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "1\n",
        "2\n",

        "\n",
        "Key point:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Here’s a scenario where a **while loop** is more suitable than a for` loop:\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario: User Input Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you want to ask a user to enter a password that meets certain criteria (e.g., at least 8 characters long). You don’t know in advance how many attempts the user will take to enter a valid password.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is ideal for a while loop because you want to keep repeating until a condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "password = \"\"\n",

        "Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The loop continues until the user enters a password that is 8 or more characters long.\n",
        "\n",
        "We don’t know the number of iterations in advance, so a for loop isn’t practical here.\n",
